## Step 1: Data Preparation
- analyze data and visualize 
- Image Preprocessing:
- Resize images to a standard dimension 
- Normalize pixel values 
- Augment data ( if needed )
## Step 2: Model Selection
- pre-trained CNN model or Custom CNN arch ( if needed) 
## Step 3:Model Training
- Optimize hyperparameters and apply suitable optimizer and loss function
- hyperparameter search 
## Step 4:  Model Evaluation
- Our Metrics: Accuracy, Recall, Confusion Matrix 
- dropout layers or early stopping  can apply ( if  overfits ) and cross-validation can be used 

## Notes from slides : 
analyze and add comment for each step 
add standart graphs as much as possible :  loss curves, accuracy chart, simple architectureÂ graphics...


# Important

Git desktop is giving errors with the the 3Gb dataset (also having a .gitignore), so you must have the dataset just outside the directory.
